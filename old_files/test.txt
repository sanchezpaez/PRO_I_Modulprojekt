You are home alone with your lovely cat. The tiny problem is that she won't stop meowing, so you need to find her favourite toy to shut her up. You are free to wander around the flat and interact with objects. Pay attention to details and ask for help when you need it. 

If you please the cat you will be able to enjoy the silence! :)
