There is some mayonnaise and a knife on the table.

Welcome to 'Please the Cat', Sandra!

How would you describe yourself?
>temperamental

'temperamental', I'll remember that.

Choose a number from 1 to 5?
>3

Ok. You will start the game with 3 lives.

You love your cat, but she is very annoying when she doesn't find her toy. 
Find it and she will stop meowing.


You are in the kitchen. One would think there is something here to please that cat of yours. Check every item carefully, things are not what they seem...

There is some mayonnaise and a knife on the table.

What do you want to use?

This stuff is in your pockets:
mayo - You can still have a few fries with it.
You can use this 2 more time(s).
flower seeds - Once you plant them they will be gone.
You can use this 1 more time(s).
>flower seeds
You planted the seeds, well done! But wait, are those flowers not poisonous?

That was a near-to-death experience. But what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (kind of).

You have 2 lives left.

There is no flower seeds left.
